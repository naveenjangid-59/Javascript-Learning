# Javascript-Learning


- documentation to follow 
    1.  https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/        - standardised JS(not a JS documentation, it's a standard to write JS)
    2.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/              - by mozilla org
 
    ( use 2 only, in some cases refer 1)

- Objects and web events are very much or most important ones


- Dynamically typed or statically typed language ?  
Yes ✅ JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
    You don’t declare the type of a variable (like int, string, bool).
    The type is decided at runtime, depending on the value you assign.
    A variable can hold values of different types at different times.


-  Stack & Heap Memory : 
    - Primitive (stack) , Non-Primitive (Heap) 
    -  stack se copy create hoti hai & heap se referece

-  Variables in JS are Very Powerfull, they can hold so much things

-  ES6 in 2015, with lot of new features ( `one of them is arrow function` )


-  ### IMPORTANT
    - RUN console.log(this) in browser console and node environment
    - MOst Global object in browser -- WINDOW OBJECT
    - MOst global object in node environment -- {} empty object

    - If you use this in a standalone function, in strict mode it is undefined, in non-strict mode it is widnow object

    - Arrow functions differ in their handling of this: they inherit this from the parent scope at the time they are defined. This behavior makes arrow functions particularly useful for callbacks and preserving context
