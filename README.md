- Dynamically typed or statically typed language ?  
Yes ✅ JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
    You don’t declare the type of a variable (like int, string, bool).
    The type is decided at runtime, depending on the value you assign.
    A variable can hold values of different types at different times.
